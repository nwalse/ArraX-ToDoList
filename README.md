# ArraX

## Why:
After using to-do list apps such as Apple Reminders and Notion, I still haven't been able to stick to one. Many of the apps have a set of great features but also have downsides. Notion is great because it is so customizable, but it doesn't have enough reminder features and can be overwhelming to use. Apple Reminders has great reminder features, but they take too many steps to use. So, I decided to make my own app using the best parts of both apps.
