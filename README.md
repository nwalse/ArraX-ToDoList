## Why:
After using to-do list apps such as Apple Reminders and Notion, I still haven't been able to stick to one. Many of the apps have a set of great features but also have downsides. Notion is great because it is so customizable, but it doesn't have enough reminder features and can be overwhelming to use. Apple Reminders has great reminder features, but they take too many steps to use. So, I decided to make my own app using the best parts of both apps.

## Focus:
A large problem that I noticed with to-do list apps is that many of them are focused on getting people to use their app by adding social features such as progress sharing or accountability partners. My app instead focusses more on making the mechanical features of the app smoother. The app is designed for people who need to be able to write down their tasks as efficiently and organized as possible. Most of these features needed to be built out in order to be used such as Completion Delay(allows a user to undo the completion of a task by pausing before the task is deleted from the view, the paused state is faded out by 50% to show that it is waiting just in case the user wants to uncheck the mark). Another thing that I made sure to keep in mind was making the number of clicks to enter a new task as small as possible. Many people who use to-do list apps are list tasks as a person is saying them out-loud. This means that the process of inputting a task needs to be as fast as possible so no information is missed or needs to be repeated. Features like these make the app more usable and streamlined.
